# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This simulates and compares 9 different CPU scheduling algorithms, including a newly added hybrid of Round Robin and Priority Scheduling.

## Algorithms:
FCFS<br/>
SJF<br/>
SJF(Preemptive)<br/>
LJF<br/>
LJF(Preemptive)<br/>
Priority<br/>
Round Robin<br/>
Proposed<br/>

## New Hybrid Algorithm(Proposed):
Round Robin + Priority Scheduling: Processes with higher priority are scheduled first, and if priorities are equal, Round Robin is used for fair time-sharing.

## Features:
Visualizes process scheduling with a timeline.<br/>
Allows for customizable parameters.<br/>

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.<br/>
Open index.html in a web browser.<br/>
Navigate through "Add Process" , "Edit Process" , "Remove Process" , "Evaluate" , "Visualise".<br/>
View the output, Gantt chart and visualise to analyze the scheduling results.<br/>
